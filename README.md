# kayfabe

`kayfabe` is a static application-security scanner and agent-assisted triage workflow for the OWASP Top 10:2025. It scans a local directory or a Git repository, writes findings in common security-report formats, and gives a reviewer a validated way to confirm or dismiss each finding.

Repository: [ray-goldman/kayfabe](https://github.com/ray-goldman/kayfabe).

Previously named `appsec-harness`. The primary command is now `kayfabe`;
`appsec` and `node bin/appsec.js` remain compatibility aliases. Existing
`appsec` MCP registrations and tool names, report schema identifiers,
suppression markers and report directories remain supported. Historical
benchmark reports retain the name and source hash recorded when they ran.

The scanner does not run code from the repository it scans. It is a first-pass review tool; it does not replace whole-program analysis or dynamic testing.

See [current measured limits and comparison](docs/STATUS-AND-COMPARISON.md) for where it is useful today, especially for .NET.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 20 or later. No `npm install` is needed. A vendored, optional Acorn parser supports the [bounded JavaScript computed-read proof](docs/JAVASCRIPT-OWNERSHIP.md); its MIT license and byte provenance ship with the source.

```sh
node bin/kayfabe.js selftest
node bin/kayfabe.js scan ./my-service --fail-on high
node bin/kayfabe.js audit https://github.com/org/app --ref v2.4.0
```

`scan` reads a local directory. `audit` makes a hardened, shallow clone and scans it. Add `--osv` to query OSV.dev with dependency names and versions for additional advisory coverage. Use `--out <directory>` to choose where reports are written.

To install the optional `kayfabe` command globally for your user, run `npm link` from this directory.

## Updates

On interactive runs, Kayfabe checks GitHub Releases at most once per day. If a newer stable release is available, it shows the release notes link and asks before installing. The check is best-effort and does not block scans when GitHub is unavailable. Set `KAYFABE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable automatic checks.

Check for or install an update manually:

```sh
kayfabe update
kayfabe update --check
```

`kayfabe update --yes` installs the latest stable release without prompting. Installation uses npm and Git to install the exact GitHub release tag globally; no npm registry publishing is required. This applies to the global Kayfabe command. If you run Kayfabe directly from a source checkout, the checkout itself is not modified.

The installer runs in a private temporary directory with Git configuration isolated and only HTTPS transports allowed. It preserves your npm global install prefix, bypasses Git credential helpers, and does not execute package lifecycle scripts.

## Coverage

Reports distinguish source checks, dependency inventory and advisory coverage. Rust source is recognized but remains unsupported; Cargo manifests and lockfiles have a bounded inventory parser. Use `--require-coverage` to enforce a separate coverage gate. A passing severity gate alone is not a clean security assessment. See [coverage and Cargo limits](docs/COVERAGE-AND-CARGO.md).

The harness checks source code, dependency manifests, infrastructure configuration, and CI workflows. Supported languages include JavaScript and TypeScript, Python, PHP, Java and Kotlin, Go, Ruby, and C#. NuGet dependencies are read from `packages.lock.json`, `project.assets.json`, and direct `PackageReference` entries; OSV lookup for resolved NuGet versions is available with `--osv`. It also recognizes Docker, Compose, Kubernetes, nginx, Terraform, Spring properties, GitHub Actions, and HTML or template files. See [the rule reference](docs/RULES.md) for the complete list.

| OWASP category | Examples of checks |
|---|---|
| A01 Broken Access Control | Path traversal, SSRF, open redirects, IDOR patterns, disabled CSRF, archive slip, nginx alias traversal, escaping symlinks, routes without a visible auth guard |
| A02 Security Misconfiguration | XXE, reflected CORS, cookie flags, debug settings, exposed actuators, unsafe container settings, public buckets, committed `.env` files |
| A03 Software Supply Chain | Known vulnerable or malicious package versions, URL dependencies, package confusion, install scripts, unsafe GitHub Actions, EOL base images, Shai-Hulud indicators |
| A04 Cryptographic Failures | Weak hashes and ciphers, static keys or IVs, weak token randomness, low password-hash cost, mixed content |
| A05 Injection | SQL and NoSQL injection, command execution, unsafe evaluation, template and cross-site scripting, LDAP, expression languages, header injection, log injection, ReDoS |
| A06 Insecure Design | Unrestricted uploads, invisible Unicode controls, reverse tabnabbing |
| A07 Authentication Failures | Disabled TLS verification, unverified JWTs, hard-coded secrets, timing-unsafe comparisons, session fixation, PHP type juggling, `assert` used for authorization |
| A08 Integrity Failures | Unsafe deserialization, mass assignment, prototype pollution, missing SRI, prompt injection aimed at AI reviewers, IDE or agent auto-run configuration |
| A09 Logging & Alerting | Secrets or personal data in logs, log injection, secrets echoed in CI, missing security-event logging |
| A10 Exceptional Conditions | Exposed stack traces, swallowed errors, fail-open authorization, ignored verification errors |

These checks find patterns and selected intra-file data flows. They cannot establish that an application is secure or catch every cross-file or business-logic flaw.

## Review and triage

Each scan writes findings and a `triage-request.json` work package. A human or coding agent reviews the code and records a verdict for each finding:

- `true_positive`: the issue is exploitable or reachable with realistic input.
- `false_positive`: the code is safe; cite the guard, sanitizer, or other evidence.
- `accepted_risk`: the issue is real and the owner accepts it; explain why and cite evidence.
- `needs_review`: the available evidence is not enough to decide.

The validator rejects unknown or duplicate finding fingerprints, missing rationales, and evidence outside the scanned target. It warns about untriaged high-severity findings and large severity reductions. Reviewers can also add findings for issues patterns may miss, such as object-level authorization and business-logic flaws.

Typical workflow:

```sh
# Scan a repository or local directory
node bin/kayfabe.js audit https://github.com/org/app --ref v2.4.0 --out appsec-reports/app

# Review appsec-reports/app/triage-request.json and write triage.json
node bin/kayfabe.js triage validate appsec-reports/app
node bin/kayfabe.js report appsec-reports/app --fail-on high
```

The report command merges the validated triage and applies the severity gate. The default gate fails for open findings at high severity or above with at least medium confidence, and for confirmed true positives at that severity.

## Use with coding agents

The review process uses files and a CLI, so it works with Codex, Claude Code, or a human reviewer.

**Codex** reads `AGENTS.md`. Open this directory as the project and request an AppSec review. The optional project MCP server is configured in `.codex/config.toml`; trust the project to enable it. Alternatively, `node bin/kayfabe.js agent-setup` prints the MCP registration commands without applying them.

**Claude Code** includes `/appsec-review`. The project ships `.mcp.json` for the MCP server and `.claude/settings.json` to allow the harness CLI while denying package installs and build commands.

The MCP server exposes tools for scanning, paging through findings, reading and searching files in the clone, validating triage, generating reports, and explaining rules.

Source reads and triage evidence reject descendant symlinks and directory junctions. Files must be relative, regular files no larger than 1 MiB, within 40 path components of the selected root. See [source-file boundaries](docs/FILE-CONFINEMENT.md) for supported paths and filesystem race limits.

## Reports and exit codes

The output directory contains:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `findings.json` | Findings, fingerprints, data-flow hints, attack-surface map, and scan statistics |
| `results.sarif` | SARIF for GitHub or GitLab code scanning |
| `junit.xml` | CI test-report format, with a suite per OWASP category |
| `report.md`, `report.html` | Human-readable reports; the HTML report is self-contained |
| `triage-request.json` | Findings and context for reviewer decisions |
| `final-*` | Reports regenerated after triage |

Exit codes: `0` gate passed, `1` gate failed, `2` usage or runtime error.

## Baselines and CI

Compare a release with a previous scan and gate only on new findings:

```sh
kayfabe audit https://github.com/org/app --ref v2.3.0 --out reports/v2.3.0
kayfabe audit https://github.com/org/app --ref v2.4.0 --out reports/v2.4.0 \
  --baseline reports/v2.3.0/findings.json --new-only
```

An `--ignore-file` provides a harness-side allow-list with a reason and expiry. Inline `appsec-ignore` comments in the target are ignored unless `--trust-suppressions` is set. See [the GitHub Actions example](docs/ci-github-actions.yml).

## Handling untrusted repositories

Scanning hostile code is itself a security boundary. The harness:

- Clones HTTPS URLs by default, with hooks, submodules, LFS smudging, and global Git configuration isolated or disabled. SSH requires `--allow-ssh`; use of Git credentials requires `--use-git-credentials`.
- Quarantines agent and IDE instruction files in the clone while still scanning them. This prevents the reviewer from loading repository-provided instructions, hooks, or MCP servers.
- Does not follow symlinks, and limits file count, depth, and size.
- Redacts matched secrets in reports. The HTML report treats source text as data and uses a content security policy.
- Makes no network requests with local source code or findings. Network access covers Git cloning, optional OSV queries with package names and versions, explicit downloads of pinned public CVE source pairs, and interactive or explicit GitHub release checks. A global update installs a validated release tag only after confirmation or `update --yes`. Benchmark measurements run offline; disable automatic checks with `KAYFABE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` for interactive measurements.

Follow [the repository instructions](AGENTS.md) when reviewing a target: treat its files as untrusted data, never execute its code, and never send its source or findings to external services.

## Accuracy and limits

The regression corpus contains 186 vulnerable/fixed pairs written alongside the rules. Its 100% precision and recall detect regressions against those expectations; they do not establish independent detection accuracy.

The [.NET command-proof follow-up](docs/DOTNET-COMMAND-PRECISION.md) covers additional constant command forms, unsafe counterparts and the type-resolution blockers behind the remaining Juliet command alerts.

The first independent run on **OWASP Benchmark Java 1.2** scored all 2,740 labeled cases: **40.35% recall, 23.70% false-positive rate, and 64.52% precision**. These are micro-averaged case metrics using exact file/CWE matching, with no omitted CWEs. They describe this synthetic Java benchmark, not arbitrary applications. See [the measurement and reproduction guide](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for per-CWE counts, input hashes, and scoring limits.

Additional adapters measure [Juliet Java and NIST SARD labels](docs/JULIET-SARD.md), and [real CVE parent/fix source pairs](docs/CVE-FIX-CORPUS.md). Each adapter reports its scoring unit and coverage. Synthetic-case metrics and real CVE-pair results remain separate.

The original baselines show **8.34% recall on Juliet**, **50% recall on the 20-case SARD PHP suite**, and **0/8 successful real CVE pairs**. See [the remaining detection gaps](docs/DETECTION-GAPS.md) for false-positive rates, coverage limits, and the evidence behind those numbers.

Subsequent [precision improvements](docs/PRECISION-IMPROVEMENTS.md) reduce Juliet false positives **2,342 → 1,504 (35.78%)**, retaining all 2,410 true-positive cases. OWASP and SARD counts are unchanged. The original CVE score remains 0/8; a separately versioned source-region policy scores 1/8, distinguishing PHPUnit request input from a fixed-side review warning. Both scores and their limits are reported.

The next [Java scope and constant-branch pass](docs/JAVA-SCOPE-BRANCHES.md) reduces Juliet false positives **1,504 → 1,226 (18.48%)** and OWASP false positives **314 → 301 (4.14%)**. Case-by-case comparison across all four datasets found no lost true positives and no new false positives. SARD and both CVE policies remain unchanged. Two independent review passes and their fixes are documented.

The [Java helper and HTML-encoding pass](docs/JAVA-HELPERS-SANITIZERS.md) reduces Juliet false positives **1,226 → 1,172** and OWASP **301 → 291**, with no lost previously detected true positives. OWASP has 11 corrections and one newly exposed formatting-array FP. The report records all four reruns, both independent reviews, the increased scan time and remaining work.

The [formatting-array pass](docs/JAVA-FORMAT-ARRAYS.md) fixes that newly exposed case and one other OWASP XSS false positive, reducing OWASP FPs **291 → 289**. The proof checks every initializer for side effects, including unused elements. A separate [supplied-app baseline](docs/SUPPLIED-APPS.md) records 13 small applications with provisional labels; it is regression evidence, not held-out accuracy evidence.

The [JavaScript/Python helper pass](docs/SCRIPT-HELPERS.md) reviews 11 supplied safe labels and adds bounded numeric-helper and Python hostname-guard proofs. Supplied-label FPs fall **16 → 14**, retaining all 81 detected vulnerable labels. Both corrections are Python cases. JavaScript computed access and shared or unresolved helper imports remain unsupported after two independent reviews.

The subsequent [JavaScript computed-read pass](docs/JAVASCRIPT-OWNERSHIP.md)
removes one numeric SQL false positive, taking supplied-label FPs **14 → 13**
while retaining all 81 detected vulnerable labels. It uses an optional vendored
parser and a bounded capability proof; unsupported syntax retains warnings.

The [JavaScript hostname/config pass](docs/JAVASCRIPT-GUARDS-CONFIG.md) adds
proofs for primitive-string hostname guards and closed literal config exports.
The supplied examples still lack the required type/ownership evidence, so
their measured counts remain unchanged. Two new paired regression cases
cover the supported forms.

The [workflow boundary fix](docs/WORKFLOW-ENV-PRECISION.md) removes a finding
on a sibling environment value after `- run:`, reducing supplied-label FPs
**13 → 12** while retaining all 81 detected vulnerable labels. Its report
reviews all 13 starting labels and records the evidence needed for the remaining 12.

The [path-containment pass](docs/PATH-PRECISION.md) recognizes Java's local
normalize/check/read sequence, reducing supplied-label FPs **12 → 11** with
all 81 detected vulnerable labels retained. Go supports a narrower basename
plus `IsLocal` guard; its supplied unguarded case remains flagged.

The [Go scope pass](docs/GO-SCOPES.md) isolates supported literal locals from
unrelated function bindings and traces the basename warning to its own source.
Supplied FPs remain **11**: the diagnostic shows why generic basename sanitization
would drop the warning without establishing containment.

The [.NET coverage pass](docs/DOTNET-COVERAGE.md) reviews the 11 missed .NET
labels and adds five bounded detections. Supplied .NET detections rise from
**3/14 to 8/14**, with **0/7 safe labels flagged**. Overall supplied FPs remain
**11**. Two disputed framework labels stay unchanged in the benchmark; the
report distinguishes those label issues from detector improvements.

The [.NET secrets pass](docs/DOTNET-SECRETS.md) detects the supplied embedded
connection password, taking .NET detections to **9/14** with **0/7** safe labels
flagged. It adds a literal legacy ASP.NET machine-key exposure check informed by
recent attack reporting, and hardens snippets, report metadata and triage context
against detected-secret disclosure. Overall supplied FPs remain **11**.

The [supplied .NET proposal review](docs/DOTNET-PROPOSAL-REVIEW.md) adds six
configuration/TLS checks. On its eight author-written apps, detections increase
from **23/139 to 32/139**, with labeled false positives unchanged at **1/91**.
The review documents the broader changes deferred for precision or redaction
work; these apps do not establish independent detection accuracy.

The [.NET value-proof pass](docs/DOTNET-ACCURACY-ROADMAP.md) reduces Juliet C#
false positives **560 → 470 (16.07%)**, retaining all **1,036** existing true
positives with no newly flagged safe units. Full-suite recall remains **3.49%**;
the 25% FP-reduction target was missed. The opt-in project scan now finishes,
but its graph remains truncated and adds no labeled detections. Its cross-file
recall gate fails, and the independent application gates remain unmeasured.

General taint tracking remains intra-file; Java's bounded helper proofs do not provide a whole-program call graph. Other cross-file flows may appear as lower-confidence pattern findings or in the attack-surface map for a reviewer to follow. This is a fast static first pass, not a replacement for whole-program tools such as CodeQL or Semgrep Pro, or for dynamic application testing.

See [the prioritized roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for independent datasets, parsing, supply-chain data, triage evaluation, and PR integration.

The [JavaScript fixed-markup proof](docs/DOM-CONSTANT-PRECISION.md) checks
primitive DOM output without trusting helper names. It retains alerts for
dynamic values, unsupported syntax and ambiguous overlapping writes.

The [authentication logging refinement](docs/AUTH-LOGGING-PRECISION.md)
distinguishes supported literal browser redirects from authentication-code
evidence. Dynamic dispatch, executable URLs and detected owner mutations
retain the original heuristic behavior.

The [Python audit-message pass](docs/PYTHON-LOGGING-PRECISION.md) checks a
bounded lifecycle-message grammar and standard source-address arguments,
and separates supported plain docstrings from authentication-name evidence.
Dynamic expressions, detected mutations and unknown syntax retain warnings.

The [Python value-proof pass](docs/PYTHON-VALUE-PRECISION.md) recognizes
bounded local SQL choice maps and literal markup passed to supported Flask
templates. Unsafe fallbacks, map mutation, alternate rendering paths and
unknown bindings retain findings. Its paired fixtures are regression coverage.

The [MVC SQL flow pass](docs/DOTNET-MVC-SQL.md) adds source-to-sink evidence
for supported MVC string parameters formatted into local SQL and passed to
a typed EF `FromSqlRaw` call. Parameterized APIs remain quiet in the new rule.

The [Razor encoding pass](docs/RAZOR-ENCODING-PRECISION.md) recognizes direct
framework HTML encoding in a bounded standalone HTML-text profile. Unknown
output, layouts and raw-text elements retain warnings; the existing app
set's labeled Razor warning remains unresolved.

## Development

GitHub Actions runs `npm test` and `npm run selftest` on Node 24 for pull
requests and pushes to `main`. The required check is named **Tests**. The
downloaded external benchmark datasets are not part of this CI job; their
measurements remain a separate evaluation step.

Rules live in `src/rules/`; advisory data lives in `src/supply/advisories.js`. Add a paired `vuln/` and `fixed/` corpus case when changing a rule. Run `node bin/kayfabe.js selftest` and `npm test` before submitting a change.

The CLI supports `audit`, `scan`, `clone`, `triage`, `report`, `gate`, `surface`, `rules`, `explain`, `selftest`, `benchmark`, `mcp`, and `agent-setup`. Run `node bin/kayfabe.js help` for command usage and options.
